<h2>In-development Macro for BSS quests.</h2></centre>

Hi! I'm <b>NegativeZero,</b> and I'll be introducing you to my <b>macro for quests in BSS!</b><br>
This is a project which is <b>part of an ambition I had to learn how to code.</b> I felt learning something more simple like this would <b>make a fun project to keep me busy.</b><p>
First, to set up the macro, you need to <b>extract the .zip file, by right clicking it and clicking extract.</b> Simple! Next, run "Start.ahk" to open the macro. Please note that it is <b>currently open for testing and very far from complete.</b><br>
Enter any details that you need to. Importantly, you need to confirm your hive slot (slot 1 being closest to the red cannon and slot 6 being closest to the noob shop) and your movespeed, which you can find in your BSS settings (make sure you have no haste when you check).<br>
Next, choose your sprinkler, and for testing purposes, you can choose one of these paths that currently work:<ul>
<li>Sunflower</li>
<li>Dandelion</li>
<li>Cannon</li></ul><br>
(You can use F6 to test them)<p>
Bees in hive is also important, so the macro knows where you can and can't go.<br>
Finally, reps and convert delay. Convert delay is the time (in seconds) to wait while converting. This will be the system until an automatic detection is made. Reps is the amount of times a field's pattern will repeat before it realigns.<p>
Congrats! You set up the macro. F1 to start and F6 for field testing. F3 to reload and F4 to close.<br>
Please DM me on Discord if you have any suggestions, concerns, ideas etc. and if you would like to be a tester or make contributions! My username is "negat1vezero".<br>
Thanks for downloading!
